notes/ thoughts:

1: So how about that @winning_board = @players_board thing, huh?  Looks like once you set a "route" with an instance variable, it stays that way until you change it.  Makes sense.  Variables have scope.  So the scope of the instance variable is the instance of the class.  But I guess extra weird is this idea of one variable changing and then affecting the other "in reverse" - so after I set @winning_board = @players_board, changes to the former got made to the latter.  It's all in constant motion, behind the scenes, much more than I have realized.

2: I'm definitely starting to want to "automate" as much as possible.  I am getting to the point where doing anything twice makes me want to look for a new way to look at it.  I think this is good just from a problem solving perspective.  I'm sure Anshul will have many other reasons why it's good.  A good case in point, though, would be the add_dashes function I just wrote.  All I have to do is use it twice on two different arrays.  But even that seems too repetitive.  Shouldn't there be a way to use a function twice in a row, in one line of code?  Gonna look this up.

...and duh!  The answer is simple - just toss the two arrays into a third array and pass each element to the function.  Nice!

More importantly, I learned a bunch more things about methods and their capabilities that will be super useful down the road....
