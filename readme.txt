The Original Hexagonal Rooms

This is a puzzle game masquerading as a text adventure game.  Part of the game is figuring your way around the rooms.  Then there are puzzles to play in each of them.

This project came out of an exercise in Learn Ruby The Hard Way.  I am learning Ruby via building this project.

To run it, collect all ten .rb files in one directory and type "ruby ex43engine.rb."  At the moment it is incomplete so it will crash depending on where in the rooms you try to go.  The red room does have something you can do, however.
